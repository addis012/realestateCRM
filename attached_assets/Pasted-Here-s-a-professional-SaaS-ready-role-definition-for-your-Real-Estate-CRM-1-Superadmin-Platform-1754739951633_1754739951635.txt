If you want, I can also prepare a role-to-permission matrix for your developers so that access control is clear in the backend APIs.
That way, when we implement JWT role-based auth, it’s already mapped perfectly.

Do you want me to make that permissions matrix?

Here’s a clear Role-to-Permission Matrix for your SaaS Real Estate CRM.
This can be used directly in your JWT Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) logic for the backend.

How to Implement
Store role in JWT payload: { id: "userId", role: "admin", tenantId: "abc123" }

Middleware checks:

Role Permissions (from this matrix)

Tenant ID Isolation (users can only touch their tenant’s data)

Ownership Rules (Sales can only access assigned leads)
